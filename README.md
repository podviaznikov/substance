## Development

Install the dev dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Run the dev server.

```
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5550/docs` for the docs and `http://localhost:5550/test` for the test suite. Test suite and docs are rebuilt as you make changes to the source files.

If you only work on the documentation, this recompiles faster.

```
npm run docs
```

To run the test-suite headless.

```
$ npm test
```
